 It is a tool that allows multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other's work.
 Git manages and tracks changes to files, enables branching and merging, and provides a history of changes.

 ## What is GitHub?

 GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control.
 It provides a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories.
 GitHub offers additional features such as collaboration tools, issue tracking, and project management.
